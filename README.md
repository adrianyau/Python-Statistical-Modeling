# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The project was to showcase our fundamentals and knowledge of Python functions, including NumPys and Pandas, as well as applications of Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Modelling. The goal was to use APIs to scrape data from CitiBikes, Foursquare, and, Yelp and establish relationships, if any, between the number of bikes and various locations (points of interests) with the city of our choosing.  The data was collected to wrangle, clean, and combine for exploratory and visual analysis.
